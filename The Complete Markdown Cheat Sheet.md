# **THE COMPLETE MARKDOWN GUIDE:** 
## **A reference guide to all the Markdown syntax**
This is simple guide i put together while learning Markdown Syntax. it's an overview of all the Markdown syntax both Basic & Github Flavored to help developers or technical Authors to write better software documentation, Markdown academic documents and other Technical Writing endeavour.

### **Background**
In 2019 i took on a job as an Andriod Developer. I didn't know much but during that period up until mid 2021, i learned about Mobile development projects, DevOps, Project Management, how to us Github and Technical Writing. I also got an idea of which Roadmaps to follow as a Mobile Developer, Web Developer, Data Scientist or Project Manager.

To improve my Technical Authoring skills, i decide to master the Markdown syntax and this document is my humble contribution thanks to a number of references.

Check out my [README](https://github.com/piusmnwilson/markdown/blob/main/README.md) for an explaination of what a readme file is. 

This file is a modified version of my initial [markdownCheatsheet](https://github.com/piusmnwilson/markdown/blob/main/markdownCheatsheet.md) file
